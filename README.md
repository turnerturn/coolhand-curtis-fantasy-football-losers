# Fantasy Football Loser Lounge

This is the lounge for all last place winners of the "Cool Hand Curtis" fantasy football league.

## How do I add new last place winners to the plaque?

To add a new last place winner to the plaque, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the GitHub repository at the following URL: [https://github.com/turnerturn/coolhand-curtis-fantasy-football-losers](https://github.com/turnerturn/coolhand-curtis-fantasy-football-losers)

2. Create a new account if you haven't already signed up for GitHub.

3. Login with your GitHub account.

4. Navigate to our repository's `index.html` at [https://github.com/turnerturn/coolhand-curtis-fantasy-football-losers/blob/main/index.html](https://github.com/turnerturn/coolhand-curtis-fantasy-football-losers/blob/main/index.html)

5. Click the edit icon aligned in the top right of the file's header panel.

6. Find where we define our accolades JSON object by finding the instance of text `const accolades`.

7. Scroll through the lines following our accolades. This JSON array defines our timeline's accolades. Go to the bottom of this JSON array and add a comma to the last item and insert your intended details. (Example for appending item for the year of 2025 below.)

    ```json
    ....,
    {
        "year": 2024,

        "owner": "Aaron Grippando",
        "teamName": "A Grip",
        "memeUrl": "https://g.espncdn.com/lm-static/logo-packs/ffl/BoneHeads-ToddDetwiler/BoneHeads-01c.svg",
        "quote": "Youâ€™ve turned losing into an art form!"
    }
    , {
        "year": 2025,
        "owner": "John Doe",
        "teamName": "Not A Team",
        "memeUrl": "https://i.imgflip.com/26am.jpg",
        "quote": "The world's biggest loser"
    }
    ```

8. Click Commit Changes (Green button on top right of the web interface).
